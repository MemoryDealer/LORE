--- Features ---
-Fix gl 1282 regression
-Rename resource controller to ResourceCenter?
-Debug tools - view memory pools for each type, hover over to view details
-Resource file location indexing for easy reloading (see ResourceController.h).
-Sprites! - rename Texture to Sprite; textures will become a sprite with a single texture/frame
-Re-organize to include/src directories
-RTT (add priority to renderview, RTTs are automatically rendered before window framebuffers)
-Multi-texturing
-Instanced rendering - for static objects (maybe static nodes - StaticNodeBlock)
-Polish resource cloning
-Normal mapping
-Lua scripting system, callbacks into bound lua scripts to nodes/scenes.
-Resource configuration files - materials, scenes, textures all loaded into group via .rsrc file.
  Lua bindings for configuration and resource files
-Input: Mouse clicks hitting nodes (provide helper function that converts mouse coordinates to world)
-AABB drawing, basic collision support
-Camera tracks - key frames
  Animation system for nodes with key frames
-Self-illumination for all lights
-Particle systems
-Camera zooming should affect background scale
-Proper cleanup of resources
  Write a massive test for loading a huge scene, test number of "in use" memory pool items before/after destruction
-Compositors: visualize depth buffer (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing)
-Modify memory pool to use raw uint8_t buffers, get rid of reset() functions; use default copy for each pool
-Box select of AABBs
-Post-processing effect factory to create entities to use render targets, provide helper functions to setup in one call
-Exception handling, all functions that do not throw should be noexcept
-Grid rendering
-Finish unit tests

--- Optimization ---
-TODO: Optimize text rendering to use a single texture, allow unicode.
