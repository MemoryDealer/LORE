--- Features ---
-Text rendering, FPS/frametime display
-Debug tools - view memory pools for each type, hover over to view details
-UI class; add elements in [0.0, 1.0] range. Text and boxes. Allow scrolling offsets to out of range. Can assign callback for mouse for debug UI.
-Resource file location indexing for easy reloading (see ResourceController.h).
-Sprites!
-RTT (add priority to renderview, RTTs are automatically rendered before window framebuffers)
-Multi-texturing
-Instanced rendering - for static objects (maybe static nodes?)
-Polish resource cloning
-Normal mapping
-Lua scripting system, callbacks into bound lua scripts to nodes/scenes.
-Resource configuration files - materials, scenes, textures all loaded into group via .rsrc file.
  Lua bindings for configuration and resource files
-Input: Mouse clicks hitting nodes
-AABB drawing, basic collision support
-Camera tracks - key frames
  Animation system for nodes with key frames
-Self-illumination for all lights
-Particle systems
-Compositors: visualize depth buffer (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing)
-Modify memory pool to use raw uint8_t buffers, get rid of reset() functions; use default copy for each pool
-Box select of AABBs

--- Optimization ---
-TODO: Optimize text rendering to use a single texture, allow unicode.
